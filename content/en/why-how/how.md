We all remember the joy and feeling of connection when playing board and card games with friends and family. Or the intense anger and sadness when something didn’t go our way.

Games trigger emotions in all of us, and these **emotions communicate** our inner workings the way words can never do. The following quote from Plato aptly summarizes this:

> “You can discover more about a person in an hour of play than in a year of conversation”
