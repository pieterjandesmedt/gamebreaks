We believe that **trust** is the key characteristic of high performing teams.

That this trust is created through **strong emotional connections** between team members. Such that they get to know each others ins and outs. Learn and accept each others strengths and weaknesses and assign tasks accordingly.

The fastest way to built this trust? You guessed it: playing games together.

Games stir up emotions in all of us. These **emotions communicate** our inner functioning better than words ever can. Or to put it the words of Plato:

> "You discover more about a person in an hour of play than in a year of conversation."
