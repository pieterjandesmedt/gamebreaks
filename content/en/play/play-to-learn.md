Our custom designed games teach **fundamental business principles** in a way that makes it easy to remember.

<!--more-->

Besides using existing board games, we also design and build our **own team building games**. We use these games to teach companies and teams the fundamentals of team work, team communication, agile product development, agile project management, and many other concepts.

In between gaming cycles, we moderate **short group sessions** in which the team analyzes their performance and tries to improve how they operate. All the while, we keep a close eye on how your team communicates with each other, and which key roles are present or absent in your team.
