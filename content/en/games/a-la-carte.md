You and your team invested in an old brasserie a while ago, with the goal of turning it into a successful top restaurant!

<!--more-->

Full of good cheer, you flew in: you contacted contractors, drew up menus and an ambitious marketing plan soon made you start trending on social media.

In short: everything was in place for the grand opening!

Or so you thought. With half an hour to go before the restaurant doors opened, someone suddenly asked:

_"Say, uh ... where is the staff anyway?"_ An anxious silence lingers and a slight panic creeps up on you all. _"Surely we have hired staff! ... Or have we?!"_

... Not so. No lack of self-confidence, however:

_"Bwah, we'll do it ourselves, won't we? How hard can it be!"_

In A la Carte, you dive into the atmosphere of a restaurant kitchen from the very beginning. During the game you and your team will receive customers, take orders, collect ingredients, operate kitchen appliances, prepare meals, present everything neatly on a plate and finally serve the customers. Customer satisfaction is the highest priority, but what exactly does this mean? How do you best go about achieving your goals? And perhaps most important of all: what kind of restaurant do you actually want to create?

A La Carte consists of several rounds, with a short, moderated consultation moment between each round. During this consultation moment, you analyze your collaboration, discuss what you can change and how you can improve. By listening carefully to each other and being open to quick adjustments, you will turn the initial chaos and inefficiency into the satisfying hum of a well-oiled machine.

Cook. Serve. Make money and invest. Formulate your own goals, and grow. As a restaurant, _and_ as a team.
